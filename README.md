# Chatprogram

This program makes it possible to communicate between two devices via a socket connection.
Both users can 'chat' via an input.

By modifying the code, the users are also able to send JSON files, communicating with precise data of certain sensors or modules.
That means this program can serve as a template for transfering data between two devices via the same internet connection.
